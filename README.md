# eniricML
Machine Learning notebooks on the RV precision results from [eniric](https://github.com/jason-neal/eniric).

Eniric can systematically go though the PHONEIX-ACES synthetic library and calcualte RV precision for different resolutions, rotations, speeds, stellar parameters etc. 

Can ML recover something interesting from the RV precision of thousands of combinations.
